# Hybrid-Algorithmic-Trading-Strategy-with-LSTM-and-SMA
This repository implements a hybrid algorithmic trading strategy that combines LSTM-based deep learning predictions with technical analysis indicators (SMA, RSI, ATR). The project demonstrates superior performance over traditional buy-and-hold strategies through rigorous backtesting across multiple asset classes.
